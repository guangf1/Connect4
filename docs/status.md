## Project Summary
Connect Four is a board game that was released by Howard Wexler in 1974. In a 7x6 board, a player wins when the player places pieces in any direction to form a line of length four. Under the off the shelf [Connect four environment by Lucas Bertola](https://github.com/lucasBertola/Connect-4-Gym-env-Reinforcement-learning/tree/main/exemples), which provides different levels of opponent players for us to train a model, our project explores different RL algorithms and reward strategy to train an AI that plays connect four. In our project, we will try Proximal policy optimization(PPO), deep Q-network(DQN), and Alphazero to train a powerful AI and evaluate their performances, and compare different stable baselines3 stratigies(Mlp,Cnn). The AI performance will be evaluated by rew mean score, elo ranking(environment built-in system), visulization of the actual game plays, and the winnng rate against trained models.
